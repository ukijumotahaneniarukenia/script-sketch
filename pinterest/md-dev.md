|What kind of Pinterest marketing services would your app need?|None! It's a consumer app. Read and write a few Pins, and get basic data back.|
|What kinds of customers does your app serve? Be as detailed as possible.|Images are needed for machine learning. In order to collect images, I thought that I could have a better experience by using my favorite image, so I decided to use the API of the app.|
|Do you intend to show data from other platforms (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, etc.) within the same view as Pinterest data?|No|
|Please describe how you will use Pinterest data. Be as detailed as possible. This helps with review of your app.|It is used to prepare the learning data for running the JAVA demo app. There is a lot of my favorite data in Pinterest, so the fun of searching can be expanded.|
